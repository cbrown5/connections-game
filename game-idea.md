This game will emulate the New York Times connection game. It will include a self-contained index file that has all the html, css and javascript. It will also include a separate file with JSON game data

The aim of the game is to match sets of four words. 

The game shows a four by four grid of words or phrases. The player picks (clicks or taps) four words (or phrases) they think share a similar theme, then they hit submit. If they are correct the four boxes line up and and the hidden theme for the four words is revealed. If they are incorrect the boxes shake and they make a mistake. They get four mistakes per round. Mistakes are tracked via counters at the bottom. 

The JSON data should allow a developer to easily change the sets of four words, as well as the theme word for each set of for. 

It shoudl be optimized to view on mobile.
